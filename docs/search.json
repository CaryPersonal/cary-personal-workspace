Whether this matters is context-specific: you may decide, for example, that the residuals are all so small that your model is already predicting well enough.\nNon-constant variance\n“Residuals vs Fitted Values” plot may exhibit a “funnel” shape (i.e. the residual variance seems higher at one end than the other).\n“Scale-Location” plot: the absolute residuals tend to be larger at one end than the other.\nIn this case, the least-squares estimates are not fully efficient (i.e. you’re not making the best use of your data), and the reported standard errors will be incorrect — as will the results of any hypothesis tests and confidence interval calculations.\nNon-normal residuals\n“Normal Q-Q plot”: the residuals don’t fall roughly on a straight line.\nThis is not critical in large samples, the exception is where you want to calculate prediction intervals for future observations: these will only be accurate if the future observations do indeed have an approximate normal distribution.\nLack of independence\nCommon situations in which it might be a problem are when data are collected at successive time points, or at a collection of spatial locations. Although none of the ‘standard’ plots is designed to check for this, lack of independence can lead to apparent structure in some of the residual plots. For example, if observations are collected sequentially in time and successive residuals are highly correlated, this can give the appearance of curvature in the “Residuals vs Fitted Values” plot: the curvature is not due to a nonlinear relationship between response and covariates, but simply due to the fact that neighbouring residuals are similar to each other because they are correlated.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransform the response variable and / or covariate (but only if the resulting model makes scientific sense). Sometimes, a relationship can be made more linear by taking logs or square roots of one or more quantities; transforming the response variable can also help to make the residual variance more constant, and to make the assumption of normality more reasonable. Don’t take logs (or square roots) of quantities that could be negative, though!\nAdd additional terms to the model. For the temperature data for example, you might consider extending the quadratic model to include third-degree terms in latitude and longitude; or additional covariates such as altitude if these were available.\nIf the diagnostics suggest that the residual variance is related to the fitted values (e.g. the ‘residuals versus fitted values’ plot has a funnel shape) and there is good reason to suspect that the responses follow non-normal distributions (e.g. because they are counts, so that Poisson distributions might be more appropriate) then a more general class of models may be appropriate — such as generalized linear models (GLMs)."

    "text": "What is Quarto?\nQuarto helps you have your ideas and your code in one place, and present it in a beautiful way.\nQuarto unifies and extends the RMarkdown ecosystem - it unifies by combining the functionality of R Markdown, bookdown, distill, xaringian, etc into a single consistent system. And it extends in several ways: all features are possible beyond R too, including Python and Javascript. It also has more “guardrails”: accessibility and inclusion are centered in the design. Quarto is for people who love RMarkdown, and it’s for people who have never used RMarkdown.\nThe ability for Quarto to streamline collaboration has been so cool and important for our NASA Openscapes project. Quarto has been a common place for us to collaborate - across R and Python languages and coding expertise."

    "text": "What is this tutorial?\nThis is a 1-hour tutorial that can be used to teach or as self-paced learning.\nWe introduce Quarto by exploring this tutorial website, and practicing the basic Quarto workflow using different tools (GitHub browser, RStudio, and Jupyter) for editing your website.\nWe’ll start off from the browser so you don’t need to install any additional software, however this approach is very limited and you will soon outgrow its capabilities. If you don’t already have a workflow to edit files and sync to GitHub from your computer, I recommend RStudio. You don’t need to know R to use RStudio, and it has powerful editor features that make for happy workflows.\nQuarto.org is the go-to place for full documentation and more tutorials!"

    "text": "About\nOpenscapes is about better science for future us. We help researchers reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research teams as part of the broader global open movement.\nWe’re developing this tutorial to help folks with different levels of technical skills use Quarto for documentation and tutorial building. This tutorial was originally created for several different audiences: NASA-Openscapes researcher support engineers using Python, communications directors at organizations promoting open science who do not identify as coders, and fisheries scientists curious about transitioning from RMarkdown. We’re hoping it’s useful to folks with backgrounds as wide as these; if you find it useful or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know by clicking “Edit this page” or “Report an issue” at the upper right side of any page."
