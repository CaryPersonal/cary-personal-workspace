If iCloud gets stuck during the uploading process (never finish uploading), open the [**terminal**]{.underline} and try the following:

``` {.python filename="Terminal"}
killall bird
killall cloudd
```

The codes above will terminate the core process of file synchronization, and the process will start again automatically after a few seconds.
